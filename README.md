### Description

This complete program is an Internet Cafe software built entirely by me. It is one application that belongs to a suite of software that I have developed, and it is TCPIP ready, with client - server applications written for it. Please Email me and I will send you the Systray.Ocx via Email to complete this application.
 
### More Info
 
This complete application was designed with the ignorant user in mind. It uses a flashing tray icon in the system tray which the user left or right mouse clicks on in order to use it!
